Large pieces of concrete were scattered over a 300-yard area. One piece shattered the Brilliant Co-op store window almost a half a mile away. The tomb itself was not damaged. The bomb was thought to have been made up of 40 sticks of dynamite. Damage was estimated at $1000. This was the first of nine events which occurred on 07/30/1961. The date is significant because it was within a few days of the Union of Spiritual Communities of Christ (USCC)—or Community for Orthodox Doukhobors'—decision to buy former Community land, and the election of John J.

A second bomb, the caller said, would go off on a downriver span of the bridge which handles vehicular traffic. No second bomb was found. The dynamite bomb was planted at the top of a 200-foot ladder on a section of the bridge. The explosion occurred shortly before 2 a.m. and resulted in a four-hour delay for Seaway traffic, disabling the bridge's lift mechanism, and leaving the bridge in an elevated position for two or three months. Painted letters in red, three feet high, were discovered in two locations on the bridge's superstructure. They spelled out FLQ. Despite the warning and the painted signs, the Surete provinciale noted that the bomb materials were different from those used by the FLQ in the spring wave of bombings, and that the person who placed the bomb was very familiar with the bridge mechanism, placing the bomb where it could do most damage.

The bomb was intended to be used as a symbolic act in protest of a strike stalemate. The decision to bomb the plant was made by the ""Central Committee"" of the FLQ at a St. Alphonse de Joliette hideaway. Five members of the FLQ were held criminally responsible for the victim's death, receiving sentences (on this and other counts) ranging from three years to nine years and two months. The bomb, carried in an Air Canada flight bag, was set for 55 minutes and two wires had to be joined to fuse it. The explosion it caused was heard within a two-mile radius, and shattered four stories of windows at the textile plant as well as some windows at the Stelco plant nearby. Damage to the Dominion facilities was estimated at $2,000. An earlier attempt to bomb the plant had been abandoned when the bomber's partner failed to appear; it was judged that he could not accomplish the mission alone (on the fatal attempt it was decided that the victim could operate alone). The man who made the bomb claimed that he had used as a model a device assembled by a specialist."	0	Canada	Quebec	Montreal	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	6	0	Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ)		Bombing/Explosion	Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite		Unknown Explosive Type		Business			Industrial/Textiles/Factories			Yes	No	0	0	1	0	Yes	No	-99	-99		No				"Morf, 1970: 85; Fournier, 1984: 99; The Gazette, 16 July 1966, 3; The Gazette, 19 Sept 1966,3; The Gazette, 22 Sept 1966, 3; The Gazette, 24 Sept 1966, 3; The Gazette, 29 Sept 1966,3; The Gazette, 30 Sept 1966, 3; The Gazette, 16 June 1967, 3; Journal de Montreal, 16 July 1966, 3; Journal de Montreal, 22 Sept 1966, 3; Journal de Montreal, 24 Sept 1966, 4; Stewart., 32; The Gazette, 15 July 1966; The Montreal Star, 15 July 1966, 3"	"Kellett, A., Beanlands, B., Deacon, J., Jeffrey, H., & Lapalme, C.

A watchman at the armoury reported finding broken windows during his regular rounds on the weekend. The bomb was apparently thrown at the windows in an attempt to place it inside the armoury but smashed into the protective bars and fell outside. The armoury had also been the target of a Front de Liberation du Quebec attack in 1963. The bomb was described as ""very similar"" to one planted behind a liquor store on Denis street on 8 September.

The explosions resulted in broken windows and damaged interiors, but no injuries. The bombs went off between 3:47 a.m. and 5:04 a.m. over a wide area, covering North York, Etobicoke, and Toronto; police speculated that four other homes were targeted but had somehow been spared. The bombs were cast-iron pipes about two inches in diameter and eight inches long filled with ammonium nitrate, sealed with screw-on metal caps and aimed at the houses on legs made from wire coat hangers. When the bombs were set up, the bombers unscrewed the top caps, inserted the activating chemical on top of the ammonia saIts, then put back the caps. The gases would then build up, giving the bombers about 15 minutes to escape. Most of the bombs were hidden in shubbery in front of the homes. The following day, the company offices received a note stating that the companies had been found guilty of complicity in the Vietnam War, and threatening further violence. Each of the individuals whose homes were bombed received leaflets accusing them of complicity in American policy in Vietnam, and threatening further violence.

The kidnappers were later identified as Marc Carbonneau, Jacques Lanctot, Jacques and Louise Cosette-Trudel, and Yves Langlois. In a series of notes sent to the Canadian government, the group demanded publication of a political manifesto in all Quebec newspapers; release of certain political prisoners; a chartered aircraft to fly the prisoners to Cuba or Algeria; $500,000 in gold bullion to be placed in the plane as a voluntary tax; federal jobs for 450 truck drivers belonging to Lepalme Service, a private postal firm, who had lost their jobs in a recent dispute with the federal post office; the publication of the name and photograph of an FLQ informer who led police to the discovery of an FLQ cell; and the stopping of a police manhunt for Cross. The terrorists imposed a 48 hour deadline. On October 16, the government invoked emergency powers, authorizing police and troops to conduct searches and arrest without warrants. Cross's kidnappers released him unharmed on December 4. Several individuals were flown to Cuba under the safe conduct agreement.

He was identified as a white male who met the Federal Aviation Administration profile and who had served a prison sentence for manslaughter: Del Lavon Thomas, born on December 29, 1942, in Hawthorne, California. He allowed the plane to land in Anchorage to permit the passengers to leave.  He flew on to Vancouver for refueling and then demanded to fly to Mexico City. However, an hour out of Vancouver, he ordered the plane to turn back. Upon landing, an RCMP police inspector boarded the plane. One hour later, the crew was allowed to leave, and Thomas surrendered to the RCMP.

The four employees, including three Americans, one Canadian, and their Canadian pilot, were kidnapped after their helicopter made a forced landing due to bad weather conditions. The ELF set fire to the helicopter. The group had used the helicopter on their geological survey mission for a new concession that the Ethiopian government granted to Tenneco. The ELF said that it would try three of the five hostages for exploitation of the national resources of Eritrea. They also demanded that Tenneco aid the ELF in obtaining the release of 75 prisoners, employ a journalist to publish the ELF story, suspend further explorations until the fighting between the government and ELF ended, and ensure that the hostages not return to Ethiopia. A helicopter pilot who was sent to retrieve them was kidnapped on 03/27/1974. An American nurse was taken prisoner the same day. The nurse and the second pilot were freed on June 23. A ransom demand of $1 million was announced for the first pilot, who was released three days later. After prolonged negotiations, the four remaining hostages were released unharmed on September 10.

The note read: ""1. This airplane is hijacked. 2. We are in possession of five gelignite bombs, four of which are set in cast iron pens, giving them the same kind of force as a giant grenade. 3. In addition, we have left the same type of bomb in a locker across from the Commodore Hotel on 42nd Street.... 5. The appropriate authorities should be notified from the plane immediately. 6. This plane will ultimately be heading in the direction of London, England."" The hijackers claimed to be members of the Croatian National Liberation Forces and the Fighters for a Free Croatia. The hijacked plane flew to Gander, Newfoundland - 35 passengers deplaned while the plane refuelled and was joined by a TWA B707, which was used to guide the B727 pilots to Europe. At 6:57 A.M., the 727 landed at Keflavik Air Base in Iceland, where the plane was refuelled. Upon landing in France, the group demanded to speak to President Ford, Secretary of State Kissinger, or U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Rush. Rush agreed to speak to the hijackers. After tense negotiations, the group agreed to surrender peacefully. The remaining hijackers showed the passengers that the bombs were false. "	0	United States		New York	-88	-88	-88	-88	-88	-88	-88	-88	-88	-88	-88	6	0	Croatian National Liberation Forces	Fighters for a Free Croatia	Hijacking	Fake Weapons				Airports & Aircraft			Aircraft (not at an airport)			No	No	0	3	0	0	Yes	No	No	-88		No				"Mickolus, 1980: 644-646; The Gazette, 13 Sept 1976, 1; The Montreal Star, 11 Sept 1976, 1, 2; New York Times, 14 Sept 1976, 1; Globe and Mail, 13 Sept 1976, 1"	"Kellett, A., Beanlands, B., Deacon, J., Jeffrey, H., & Lapalme, C.

The bus was travelling between Europe and India. Later reports indicated that Kurt Marfurt, 26, of Zurich, Switzerland, was killed as he crouched for cover on the bus floor. Russ Anthony Shanks of Sydney, Australia, suffered multiple bullet wounds in his stomach and legs. The 40 European, U.S., and Canadian survivors of the attack said that the bus was chartered by the U.K. firm Masic Bus Company, and was scheduled to drive from Istanbul to New Delhi through Pakistan. However, despite passengers' protests, the Turkish driver decided to save gas by going through Afghanistan. Shortly after dawn, the bus took on four Afghan soldiers to serve as guards and joined a convoy of other buses and trucks. The Turkish driver became impatient 45 minutes out of Herat and drove ahead of the convoy. A shot was fired from the right of the bus, causing the driver to stop. The attackers opened up from the left side of the vehicle. The Afghan soldiers returned the fire. After the attack, the driver disappeared, and a Swiss tourist drove the bus back to Herat."	0	Afghanistan		Unknown	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	-88	0	Muslim Guerillas		Armed Assault	Firearms		Unknown Gun Type		Tourists			Tour Bus/Van/Vehicle			No	No	2	1	0	0	Yes	No	Yes	No		No					RAND	"Mickolus, Edward F.

Denis Lortie, a supply technician at Canadian Forces Station near Ottawa, entered the Quebec National Assembly building and opened fire at assembly staff and journalists with a submachine gun. He made his way to the main chamber shortly before the starting time for a legislative committee hearing. The attack resulted in the death of three and the injury of 14, one seriously. One hundred police rushed to the building as Lortie held the sergeant-at-arms, Rene Jalbert, hostage. Negotiations continued between Quebec Justice Minister Pierre-Marc Johnson and police and Lortie until 2:25 P.M. when he gave himself up and released Jalbert unharmed. At 9:20 A.M. prior to the attack, Lortie had delivered a tape in French to the CJRP radio station saying that he would destroy ""the government in power, including Rene Levesque"" for ""doing much wrong to the French-language people of Quebec and Canada."" He had earlier fired at tourists at la Citadelle, but hit no one. While he hoped to attack legislators, the Assembly was not in session, so he attacked indiscriminately. The man was found guilty in 02/1985 on three counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment."	0	Canada	Quebec	Quebec	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	1	0	Denis Lortie		Armed Assault	Firearms		Automatic Weapon (incl. semiauto)		Government	Tourists		Politicians/Political Parties/Political Movements/Political Party Meetings/Rallies	Tourists		Yes	No	3	14	0	0	Yes	No	-99	-99		No				"Robaitail, 164; New York Times, 9 May 1984, 1; The Gazette, 9 May 1984, A1, A8; Vancouver Sun, 13 Feb 1985, A10"	"Mickolus, Edward F., Todd Sandler and Jean M.

When the terrorists entered the Embassy, Ambassador Coskun Kirca jumped to safety from a second-story window. He suffered a broken arm and leg and was listed in fair condition. The incident ended after four and a half hours at 11:30 A.M. when the three terrorists unexpectedly gave themselves up and released their hostages. The security guard died shortly after being admitted to the hospital; he had lain bleeding in the Embassy garden during the occupation."	0	Canada	Ontario	Ottawa	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	3	1	Armenian Revolutionary Army (ARA)		Hostage Taking (Kidnapping)	Firearms	Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite	Unknown Gun Type	Unknown Explosive Type	Diplomatic			Embassies/Consulates			No	No	0	1	0	0	Yes	No	-99	-99		No				"Globe and Mail, 13 Mar 1985; Los Angeles Times, 13 Mar 1985; Facts on File, Mar 1985; Ottawa Citizen, 1 Nov 1986; TVI Report, fall 1985, 20-3; Globe and Mail, 14 Oct 1986; Pinkerton Global Intelligence Services (PGIS); Charters, 1987, 7; Kellett, 1988: A-7; Ottawa Citizen, 12 Mar 1985, A1.

The Boeing 747 carried 329 people. Of the passengers aboard 279 were Canadians, seven were Americans, and most of the rest were Indian. An hour earlier a bomb placed in a suitcase aboard Canadian Pacific Airlines flight 003, en route from Vancouver to Tokyo with 374 passengers and 16 crew members, exploded after being unloaded at Tokyo Narita International Airport. The baggage aboard the Canadian Pacific flight had not been given X-ray surveillance for explosives. The report accused two Sikh extremists-Lal Singh and Annand Singh-of having placed the bomb on board. Both Singh brothers had booked tickets on flight 182; however, checking luggage on the flight for Bombay, neither of them had taken flight 182. The report also implicated the brothers in the explosion at the Tokyo airport. On 10/27/2000, RCMP officers in Vancouver arrested Ripudaman Singh Malik, 54, a millionaire who ran a Vancouver radio station, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 51, a sawmill worker from Karnloops, British Columbia, for the murder of 329 people on board Air India flight 182. They each faced eight charges, including first-degree murder, conspiracy, and attempted murder. On 03/16/2004, after a four year trial, B.C. Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson acquitted Indian-born Canadian Sikhs Ripudaman Singh Malik, 58, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, on murder and other charges in the bombing of Air India Flight 182. They were also acquitted of the bombing at Tokyo's Narita airport. "	0	Canada	Ontario	Toronto	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	2	0	Dashmesh Regiment		Bombing/Explosion	Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite		Unknown Explosive Type		Airports & Aircraft			Aircraft (not at an airport)			-88	No	329	0	0	0	Yes	No	-99	-99		No				"Mulgrew, 1988: 137-141; United States Department of State, 1985: 37; Bergeron; Pinkerton Global Intelligence Services (PGIS); Robaitail, 167; Charters, 1987, 7; New York Times, 24 June 1985, I1; Globe and Mail, 29 Jan 1986; Globe and Mail, Feb 1986; Kellett, 1988, B-7; ""Bomb  not  ruled out in explosion that sent  Air-India  jet into ocean"", Globe and Mail- Metro Edition,  23 Jan 1986, A1, A8; ""Man (Reyat) held in Tokyo airport blast case: Canada seeks extradition"", Globe and Mail - Metro Edition,  6 Feb 1988, A1, A2; ""Canada seeks extradition of suspect (Reyat) in bombing"", Toronto Star, 6 Feb 1988, A1, A16; ""British court reported set to move on Ottawa's bid for bomb-case extradition"", The Gazette, 5 Apr 1988, A10"	"Kellett, A., Beanlands, B., Deacon, J., Jeffrey, H., & Lapalme, C.

He identified himself as Saburo Kobayashi and claimed that he was acting on behalf of Shoko Asahara, the jailed Aum Shinrikyo chief charged with the sarin attack in the Tokyo subway. He held a long, sharp screwdriver to the neck of a stewardess, threatening to kill her. The passengers included nine foreigners, including Canadian David Silverman. Kutsumi demanded binoculars, refuelling, and a flight back to Tokyo. He rejected demands for direct talks and threatened to set off a bomb. The plane sat for 15 hours at Hakodate Airport. Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and his cabinet issued an order at 3 a.m. the next day to raid the airplane. At 3:42 a.m. on June 22, 20 riot police stormed the plane and seized Kutsumi.

Kutsumi was on a year's leave of absence from his job at a small Tokyo bank. He apparently had no relation to the Aum cult, which denied involvement. He later denied that he was a cult member.

The explosion killed 19 American airmen and wounded 547 others, including nearly 250 Americans, 147 Saudis, 150 Bangladeshis, four Egyptians, two Jordanians, two Indonesians, and two Filipinas. Investigators found a detonator similar to those used by Hizballah. Many suspected local Saudi Islamic radicals, perhaps aided by Iran. Scores of people were rounded up for questioning, and a Palestinian magazine in London claimed that six people belonging to the Movement for Islamic Reform, a Saudi dissident group, had confessed. According to the magazine, two Kuwaitis and two Lebanese assailants were included in the group. Ottawa immigration officials detained Hani Abdel-Rahim Hussein al-Sayegh, one of the alleged perpetrators. Canadian immigration officials also arrested Fahad Shehri, a Saudi who arrived in Canada in December and claimed refugee status. The Canadian authorities charged Shehri with being a terrorist on March 26. On May 5, Canadian Federal Judge Donna McGillis rules that there was conclusive evidence that Sayegh participated in the bombing, clearing the way for deportation."	0	Saudi Arabia		Unknown	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	-88	0			Bombing/Explosion	Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite		Vehicle		Military			Military Barracks/Base/Headquarters/Check Post			No	No	19	547	0	0	Yes	No	No	No		No				0	"Mickolus, Edward F. and Susan L.

To execute his plans, Reumayr manufactured explosives and acquired other items necessary to manufacture the bombs he intended to attach to the pipeline. He had these items in his possession at the time of his arrest, as well as maps identifying where on the pipeline he planned to place the devices. Oil pipeline officials who later reviewed Reumayr's plans determined that the attack could have interrupted oil flow through the pipeline for as many as 90 days, and would have cost at least two billion dollars in lost oil revenue and additional costs associated with clean-up and repair.

The attacks never resulted in casualties. It seems as though the bomber was taking precautions to avoid injuring or killing people. Nevertheless, the case was taken seriously by the law enforcement community: the RCMP called the attacks domestic terrorism and employed 250 investigators to work on the case, including Canada's Integrated National Security Enforcement Team.  The attacks also elicited an offer of a $1M reward (from EnCana) for information leading to the successful prosecution of the responsible party(ies) equalling the largest-ever such reward offered in Canada to date (the other time $1M was offered was for information in the Air India flight 182 bombing in 1985)."	0	Canada	British Columbia	Unknown	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	Does not adhere to the ideology	-88	0			Bombing/Explosion	Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite		Unknown Explosive Type		Utilities			Gas pipelines			Yes	No	0	0	0	0	Yes	No	-99	-99		No					Eco-terrorism Database

The two Canadians and two German tourists were released on 04/22/2009. AQIM later executed British hostage, Edwen Dyer, but released the last remaining hostage, Werner Greiner. The two Canadians had been dispatched to Niger with the intention of brokering a peace deal; the Tuareg rebels claimed responsibility for the incident but withdrew their statement after AQIM claimed responsibility. A group calling itself the Front des Forces de Redressement (FFR) claimed responsibility on 10/16 for the alleged 10/15 abduction. The FFR is purportedly led by Rhissa Ag Boula, an alleged dissident Tuareg insurgent leader. The statement said: “On 15 December, fighters of the Front des Forces de Redressement (FFR) carried out a commando operation in the Tillabery region in which we detained four people including a Canadian diplomat, Mr. Robert Fowler”. The Nigerian driver of the two Canadian diplomats kidnapped was released in an unspecified location in Mali on 03/21. No information was released as to the condition or potential release date of the Canadian hostages. 04/22/2009: Four of the six western hostages being held by AQIM militants in the Sahara desert were released by their captors to Malian officials in Gao on 04/22-the two Canadian diplomats kidnapped in December in Niger, and a Swiss national and German national who were kidnapped in Mali in January. A British national and another Swiss national remain hostages. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper declined to comment on whether a ransom had been paid for the release of the two Canadian citizens. Canadian police have charged perpetrator Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a fugitive al-Qaeda-aligned bandit based in the Sahara Desert, with the kidnapping of two Canadian diplomats almost five years ago.

After a four-day siege that started with an attack of a bus of employees headed to the airport, 40 hostages and 29 militants were killed. Ali Medlej and Xristos Katsiroubas of London, Ontario were among the attackers killed in the siege. A third Canadian, Aaron Yoon, who had travelled with Medlej and Katsiroubas to Morocco, returned to Canada after spending 18 months in a Mauritanian prison on separate terrorism-related charges.

The Prime Minister also revealed that of the 32 militants previously reported killed during the operation, three had in fact been captured alive. Sellal claimed the militants included Algerian, Tunisian, Egyptian, Malian, Nigerien, and Mauritanian nationals, as well as a Canadian national he identified by the alias Chedad, whom Sellal claimed had ""co-ordinated"" the attack.
